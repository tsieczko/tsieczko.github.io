## Hi, I'm Tom

I am an experienced software engineer with an interest in embedded systems and cybersecurity.

I graduated in 2019 from the University of Nevada, Reno with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering and
worked as a junior software engineer until my position was eliminated.

During my undergrad, I discovered a love for teaching and worked as a recitation leader for the Intro to Embedded Systems course. 
I held an optional weekly lecture where I reviewed concepts that were taught in the course with students.

My name, Tomasz, is pronounced *toh-mahsh* (marsh without the r), but I prefer to go by the anglicized Thomas or Tom. 
My last name, Sieczko, is pronounced *shehtsz-ko*.

My other interests outside of software development include 80s and 90s Japanese sports cars, classic literature, and playing the piano.
