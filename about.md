## Hi, I'm Tom

I am an experienced software engineer with an interest in software architectural quality and cybersecurity.

I graduated in 2019 from the University of Nevada, Reno with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering and I now work as a software engineer.

During my undergrad, I discovered a love for teaching and worked as a recitation leader for the Intro to Embedded Systems course at UNR.
I held an optional weekly lecture where I reviewed concepts that were taught in the course with students.

I attend the SANS technology institute to continue developing my cybersecurity skills.
I have currently earned the GIAC Security Essentials Certification and I am a member of the GIAC advisory board.

I'm highly skilled with Linux and Windows system administration and general IT.

My name, Tomasz, is pronounced *toh-mahsh* (marsh without the r), but I prefer to go by the anglicized Thomas or Tom.
My last name, Sieczko, is pronounced *shehtsz-ko*.
My full name is actually Tomaszek Sieczkovski.
